Small Sprite Manager Prototype
------------------------------

Uses bootstrap, knockout, and jquery, which are packaged herein but which I obviously do not own.
Also, require and font-awesome are in there ... I don't own those either.

Usage
-----

After cloning, install dependencies using `npm install`.

To start the Sprite Manager server, use app.js `node app.js`.  Once started, requesting http://host:8000 will open the manager.
